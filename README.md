# Lego Summit Project #

Recognising the growth of the Lego sector the company behind The Web Summit - Europe’s biggest tech event - have decided to hold a dedicated Lego summit. We want to bring together Lego builders from around the globe to meet, make, and build the future of the Lego ecosystem. 

We’ll have speakers from all over the world who have been involved in Lego movies, Lego games, Lego advertising and the creators of the Lego blocks themselves.
